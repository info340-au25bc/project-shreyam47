        <h1>Problem Description</h1>
        <p>
            With the rise of fast fashion, clothing waste is becoming increasingly more worrying for our environment. <a href="https://earth.org/statistics-about-fast-fashion-waste/">The average American throws away around 80 pounds of clothing every year, causing buildups in waste management facilities.</a> Carbon emissions skyrocket due to a continued demand for factories to produce the latest trends. Making one tee shirt can cost almost 3000 liters of water. While efforts to stop fast fashion are underway, social media has become a key contributor the problem. When new trends arrive, they spread like wildfire, and as a result, the demand for the next latest thing skyrockets. While second-hand clothing sold on apps like <a href="https://www.depop.com/?utm_source=Brand%20SEM&utm_medium=paid%20advertising&utm_campaign=PAID_GG_US_PRO_SEARCH_ALL_BRAND-CORE-DEFENCE&utm_content=depop&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21880045407&gbraid=0AAAAACrrxZvzM2YUwXyKttuSeqIiE1JQR&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59QpH5MCAZiu1h2bGrIathtZ13IfnB-U4njtGnB1luX-743Z4Wo4BwaAnsxEALw_wcB">Depop</a> are a temporary reprieve from this issue, social media continues to push for an emphasis on trending fashion.

        <h1>Proposed Application</h1>
        <p>
            Our proposed web app helps users make more informed, eco-conscious fashion 
            choices by connecting them with sustainable brands and resale platforms 
            (online thrift stores, etc.). The primary users will be shoppers that are 
            environmentally conscious particularly students and young adults who want 
            to explore sustainable alternatives. Our app will also raise awareness 
            about the environmental impact of irresponsible clothing consumption. We’ll 
            empower users to make more ethical and healthy fashion choices. Price won’t 
            be as much of a barrier like other pre-existing platforms with options like 
            thrifting and second-hand clothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the app, users will be able to input their clothing preferences such 
            as style, color, and size, and they’ll receive recommendations from 
            sustainable retailers (like Patagonia, Reformation, etc.) and second-hand 
            sites like Depop and ThredUp. Users will be able to save favorite stores or 
            items into a personalized “Sustainable Closet”, making it easy to track and 
            compare their preferred products and items. The app will include a 
            sorting/comparing option, allowing users to organize items by fabric composition, 
            price, distance, rating, or alphabetical order. Additionally, there will be a 
            built-in or outsourced calculation of sustainability that will estimate the carbon 
            emissions/water saved by choosing the secondhand or sustainable products and 
            display it on the screen. The user’s total environmental savings will be shown in 
            the section of the app interface while they are browsing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For this app, we might use external sources like Kaggle(Global Fashion Brands 
            dataset, etc.) or data.gov to get clothing material and/or trends data to 
            recommend products and/or conclude environmental impacts. By showing this 
            information in an easy-to-understand way, the app helps users see their real 
            impact and track their progress. Our app motivates people to make more 
            eco-friendly choices by showing that sustainable fashion can be easily 
            achievable and stylish.
